# LibraryTracker
Work in progress.

Simple program to track a card library, or a library of any type.

With time, I intend to integrate a web crawler into the app, in order to look up prices in cardmarket.eu, so as to update a small local database of prices pertaining to cards in the library.

Implemented features:

	-Adding/Removing cards to/from a library
	-Editing a card in the library
	-Saving and loading a library
	-Listing cards in a library
	-Updating prices of the cards in the library
	-Looking up a given card's lowest price (not necessarily in a library)

WIP (in sort of an order of priority, I guess idk):

	-Search for cards (and display single card)
	-Fetch a card's price through accessing the card
	-Recording card price at a given time
	-Ordering cards when viewing (or filtering results)
	-Display constant number of cards, and "flip pages"
	-Limit Rarities
	-Analize price fluctuations and alerting the user of them;
	-Detecting typos in input and guessing the intended input;
